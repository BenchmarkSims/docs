Northwind Traders has a well-deserved reputation for quality customer
service. However, faced with changes in distribution systems, economic
impacts to transportation and logistics, and limitations that prevent
taking full advantage of improvements in technology, Northwind Traders
faces the possibility of decreasing sales revenues due to customer
perceptions of slow delivery and services.
